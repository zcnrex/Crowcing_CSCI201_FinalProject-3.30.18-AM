CSCI201 Final Project.

Crowcing is a multiplayer car racing game based on Java. In the game, players will
control racing cars and compete for the first place in the track they chose. After picking a track,
players will then choose their cars with three attributes: top speed, acceleration, and handling.
The final result will depend on how these
three attributes apply in the specific racing track. The game would be special in that the cars have special skills other than driving, such as flying or
launching missiles on other cars. GUI components would be used to display cars, the racing tracks and the surroundings. Multi-threading would be used to implement the chat functionalities. Networking would be used to connect players so that they can play the game concurrently and chat in game.
